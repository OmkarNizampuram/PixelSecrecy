The project implements a simple steganography tool using Python's Tkinter for the GUI, along with libraries such as PIL (Python Imaging Library) and NumPy. Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another medium, such as hiding text messages within images. The program allows users to encode a message into an image using a password and decode it back using the same password. It features a user-friendly interface where users can select options to encode or decode, input source and destination paths, and enter secret keys. The project provides a practical demonstration of how steganography can be implemented in Python, making it suitable for educational purposes and exploring the concept of data hiding.
